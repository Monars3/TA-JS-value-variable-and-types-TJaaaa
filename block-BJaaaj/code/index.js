// Accessing and assigning.

//let firstName = "Arya";
//let lastName = "Stark";

// Do the following:

// Alert the value of the firstName.
// Alert the value of the lastName.
let firstName = "John";// Assign a new value of `"John"` to firstName.
let lastName = "Snow";// Assign a new value of `"Snow"` to lastName.
alert(firstName + " " +lastName)// Alert the new value of `firstName` and `lastName` by concatenating them
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName ;// Create a new varaible using `const` named `fullName` and assign the fullname using firstName and lastName seperated by space.
alert(fullName)
// Declare three variables `name,` `newUser` and `isAdmin`.
let name = "aria" ;// Assign your name as the value of `name`.
let newUser = name ;// Assign the value of `name` to `newUser`.
let isAdmin = true ;// Set the value of `isAdmin` to `true`.
alert (name +" " +newUser +" "+ isAdmin)// Alert the values of all the three variables.

// Assignment and re-assignment

var wiseMan = "Tyrion Lannister";

// Follow instructions and do the following. In case of an error write the error in comment

let wiseMan = "Samwell Tarly ";// Reassign the value of `wiseMan` to "Samwell Tarly"
var userName = "Lysa Arryn";// Declare a variable `userName` with value "Lysa Arryn"
var oddNumber = 57 ;// Declare a variable named `oddNumber` and assign a value `57`.
let oddNumber = 61;// Reassign the value of `oddNumber` to 61
alert(wiseMan + userName + oddNumber)

// Mathematical Operation

let amount = 4280;

// Using mathematical operations find the solutions. `(+, -, \*, / , etc.)`

// Declare a new variable `reducedAmount`. In it store the value that is 24 less than the value of amount.
// Declare another variable `addedAmount`. It's value should be 32 more than the value of amount.
// Declare a variable `multipleAmount`. It's value should be 7 times the value of amount.
// Declare a variable `dividedAmount`. It should store the resultant of amount divided by 57.
